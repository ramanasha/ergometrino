# ergorino
Simple arduino-based ergometer monitor with differential feedback

# Problem statement
Cardio-workout is boring, particularly when doing it indoors. Several existing project try to alleviate this by doing cool stuff such as
coupling the ergometer to a game console, or even simulating a real bicycle ride in VR. Cool as these are, technically, they don't really help much:
Workout is still boring. So, instead, I'd like to be able to just read a book or watch TV while training. But then it's difficult to keep up a
steady pace.

The idea, here, is to focus on the latter problem, and provide straight-forward feedback, on whether your current level of training is good enough,
or you should try to speed up. However, since the "good enough" level will vary not only per person, but also within the training (for instance, it's
near impossible to go at full speed before you've warmed up), the idea is simply to record a) the previous run and b) the best run (aka highscore), and
then provide feedback on how you are faring compared to those runs.
